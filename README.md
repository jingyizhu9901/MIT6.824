This repo is my self-learning journey of MIT6.824 2021 Spring version. Below is
my implementation:

- [ ] Lab 1 - MapReduce
- [ ] Lab 2 - Raft
  - [x] Part 2A - Implement Raft leader election and heartbeats
  - [x] Part 2B - Implement the leader and follower code to append new log
        entries
  - [x] Part 2C - Complete the functions persist() and readPersist() in raft.go,
        and realized faster roll-back
